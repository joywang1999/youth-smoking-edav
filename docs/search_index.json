[["index.html", "Youth Smoking Chapter 1 Introduction", " Youth Smoking Jonathan Huynh, Tengteng Tao, Jinyu Wang 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction There are three main questions we are interested in pursuing: What are the most common reasons that young people start using tobacco/e-cigarettes and how prevalent is tobacco/e-cigarette usage in young people? Is there a demographic difference (i.e. race, educational level) between tobacco/e-cigarettes usage in young people? Or some other social factor difference? Based on usage and adoption trends, should there be more strict policies to prevent or deter young people from tobacco/e-cigarette usage? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS)", " Chapter 2 Data sources Tobacco use had been more and more serious problem among youth these years. On Dec. 20, 2019, the federal minimum age for sale of tobacco product in the U.S. were raised from 18 to 21 years old. Still, youth in U.S. have some access to tobacco products. The main aim for our project is to find a pattern between youth and to provide a prevention on tobacco usage. The primary data sources we will use for this project is National Youth Tobacco Survey collected from CDC. NYTS has survey data from 1999-2020, due to the large sample size, we will only focus on data from 2016-2020 in this project. 2.1 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) Dataset used: nyts-2020.xlsx, nyts-2019.xlsx, nyts-2018.xlsx, nyts-2017.xlsx, nyts-2016.xlsx. The National Youth Tobacco Survey provides us with survey data from young people starting at the age of nine years old up through a 19 &amp; older option. The survey asks extensive questions related to tobacco including usage patterns, recency, brand loyalty, and family/friend usage patterns. We intend to use combinations of these answers to identify the patterns and trends of young people. The survey is administered annually so we will be able to compare the results of multiple years to see how trends have changed, if at all. Issues we encountered: - Although it would be nice to cross compare the trends over 20 years, survey questions and format of answers vary from year to year. Our solution is that we only selected ~30 important questions (columns) that appears in all 5 years related to our aim in this project. Also, dataset for one year have ~15000 rows and ~1000 columns, after preprocessing, we are dealing with (~100000, 40), which is much smaller and precise dataset. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Preprocessing", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Preprocessing The original datasets are in separate spreadsheets from Historical NYTS Data and Documentation. We selected some same questions across the years and create a new spreadsheet in long format where columns are Years and selected questions. Since the datasets are large, we only select 5 years to compare (2016-2020). Here is our codebook. To form our dataset, we simply append data frames from each year vertically. We also recode some missing responses to NAs to make the dataset consistent with important values and missings. However, in original data, each entries are integers like 0, 1, , they provided an additional codebook that match integer values to actual answer. Thus we have another spreadsheet which matches entries, year, and actual answer to generate final dataset. To summarize our data transformation, we turned the original dataset (head of year 2020 shown below), to a final spreadsheet looks something similar to below. The preprocessing script is in resources/data_preprocessing.R. # Data Preprocessing ################################################################################ # The data we are using are surveys in very long spread sheets across multiple # years.

To analysis missing value patterns, we created a plot_missing() function. By inputting a data set into this function, we can easily see all missing patterns in our data set. We can find the most common missing pattern and see which variable is the most common missing variable. Before analyzing our data set, lets do some example analysis by using data sets from packages as input for our function and vividly explaining their corresponding result. 4.1 Using Dataset From fivethirtyeight For our first example, we analyze the data set avengers from the package fivethirtyeight. The above missing values plot was created from a data set created by Walk Hickey, an author at FiveThirtyEight. The data set was created to observe the mortality rate of different characters in the Marvel universe who signed on to the join the Avengers. According to this figure, we can clear see the missing value pattern of the data set. We can start with the complete cases: As we can see by the dark grey row with the complete cases label, there are 10 columns in the data that do not have any missing values. Compared to the missing values pattern, complete cases in this data set are very hard to see. However, for the missing value pattern, there is another story. We can see that the most common missing value pattern is having eleven missing variables. The eleven missing variables are: death4, return4, death5, return5, death3, return3, probationary_intro, return2, death2, return1 and notes. There are around 76 rows which have such a pattern in this data set. The second most common missing pattern is missing 9 variables. The nine variables are: death4, return4, death5, return5, death3, return3, probationary_intro, return2 and death2. In the whole data set of 173 rows, there are around 42 rows which have such a pattern. For the whole 21 variables in our data set, there are six variables that are the most common missing variables: death4, return4, death5, return5, death3, and return3. For each of those variables, there are around 160 rows, which is around 10% of the whole data set, missing them. The next three most common missing variables are probationary_Intro, return2, and death2. For each of those three variables, there are around 150 variables, which is around 10% of the whole data set, missing them. For the variable return1 and notes, there are around 100 rows, which is around 8% of the whole data set, missing them separately. For columns that do have missing values, just under 75% of them are only missing one or two values. For the whole 21 variables in our data set, we can see that death4, return4, death5, return5, death3, and return3 have the majority of their column values missing. In the context of the problem, it makes sense that if the death# value is missing, then the return# value is also missing because a character cannot return from being dead if they were not killed in the first place. Additionally, we should expect the death# value to be missing for larger numbers (i.e. 3, 4, 5) if the character has not returned from being killed after death1 or death2. The probationary_intro column also has a good amount of missing values and after a bit of research into the meaning of this column, we know that this column contains values for the data that a character was given probationary status as an Avenger. Since characters can be introduced as full or reserve Avengers without taking on the probationary status, we would expect this column to be missing values for characters who skipped the probationary period. As a result of this, we would also expect the full_reserve_avengers_intro column to contain values for characters who had a missing value for the probationary_intro column and also for characters who graduated from the probationary period and became a full or reserve Avenger. We can see from the plot that this holds true with the full_reserve_avengers_intro column colored as mostly light grey except for missing pattern 13 and 14 where probationary_intro is light grey and for missing pattern 4 where it is purple for both columns. death2 and return2 have many missing values, but less so than the greater number of deaths and resurrections which makes sense because it is pretty common for a character to die in the Marval universe. For the notes column, the missing values should correspond to characters who have not died since the value is a description of deaths and resurrections. The missing values in the name_alias column are actually a problem for this data set since this column is supposed to full name or alias of the character. Inspecting the data a bit further, it looks like the url values contain the name of the characters so we would be able to fill in these missing values if it was necessary to report statistics about specific characters for an analysis. 4.2 California Tobacco Health Assessment Tool (https://cthat.org/). Note: There are multiple sheets in this dataset (California, County, City, DesignatedPlace, Unincorporated, ZCTA) which have different ways of grouping for data in California. In this chapter we are looking at County level and City level. Besides the avengers data set, we also find another two data sets and plot the missing value patterns. For those two data sets, one thing needed to be claim is that those data sets have variables in two forms, the first form is named with variables names which is the count of values, the second form is named with number and stands for the percentage of the value in that variable column. Accordingly, for this condition, the two forms of data will both be missing values if either one of them is missing value. ## # A tibble: 6 x 39 ## GEOID NAME `TOTAL POPULATI~ `UNDER 5` ...5 `5 TO 17` ...7 `UNDER 21` ...9 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 06001 Alam~ 1656754 96849 0.0585 247178 0.149 402545 0.243 ## 2 06003 Alpi~ 1039 44 0.0423 157 0.151 236 0.227 ## 3 06005 Amad~ 38429 1527 0.0397 4320 0.112 7007 0.182 ## 4 06007 Butt~ 225817 12384 0.0548 33055 0.146 58638 0.260 ## 5 06009 Cala~ 45514 1902 0.0418 5909 0.130 9012 0.198 ## 6 06011 Colu~ 21454 1576 0.0735 4266 0.199 6750 0.315 ## # ... with 30 more variables: WHITE &lt;dbl&gt;, ...11 &lt;dbl&gt;, BLACK &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # ...13 &lt;dbl&gt;, ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER &lt;chr&gt;, ...15 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # HISPANIC / LATINO &lt;dbl&gt;, ...17 &lt;dbl&gt;, ALL OTHER RACES &lt;dbl&gt;, ...19 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # HOUSEHOLD (NUMBER) &lt;dbl&gt;, HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVING SNAP BENEFITS &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # ...22 &lt;dbl&gt;, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME &lt;dbl&gt;, SCHOOLS (NUMBER) &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # HIGH SCHOOLS (NUMBER) &lt;chr&gt;, ...26 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # MIDDLE/JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL (NUMBER) &lt;chr&gt;, ...28 &lt;dbl&gt;, ... For the county data set, we can clearly see that this data set only has three missing value patterns and the majority of the data comprised of complete rows of data (complete cases are the most common pattern). For the whole 58 rows data set, around 55 rows are complete cases. There are another three missing value patterns which all have similar probabilities. For those variables which may have missing values, the most common missing variables are RETAILER.WITHIN.500ft_NUMBER and SCHOOLS.WITHIN.500ft_NUMBER. For each of those two variables, in the total 58 rows data set, there are two rows missing them separately. The next several common missing variables are ASIAN.AND.PACIFIC.ISLANDER, HIGH.SCHOOL_NUMBER, SCHOOLS.WITH.A.RETAILER.WITHIN.1.000FT.NUMBER, and RETAILERS.WITH.A.SCHOOLWITHIN1.000FT.NUMBER.

For the city data set, although the data set have a larger size than the previous data set, the majority of data is still comprised of complete rows of data (complete cases are the most common pattern). For the whole 483 rows, there are around 290 rows which have completely no missing values. For all other missing value patterns, the most common pattern is missing 4 variables, which are SCHOOL.WITH.A. RETAILER.WHITHIN. 500FT.NUMBER, RETAILERS.WITHIN.A. SCHOOL.WITHIN.500FT.NUMBER, SCHOOLS.WITH.A.RETAILER.WITHIN.1.000.NUMBER and RETAILER.WITH.ASCHOOL.WITHIN.1.000_NUMBER. There are around 40 rows that have this pattern in the data set, with 483 rows. Another widespread missing pattern is missing only one variable, HIGH.SCHOOL. NUMBER. There are around 25 rows that have this pattern in the whole 483 rows data set. For all the variables that existed in the data set, the two variables which are highly possible to have missing values are SCHOOL.WITH.A. RETAILER.WHITHIN. 500FT.NUMBER, and RETAILERS.WITHIN.A. SCHOOL.WITHIN.500FT.NUMBER. For each of them, there are 150 rows missing them separately. HIGH.SCHOOL. NUMBER., SCHOOLS.WITH.A.RETAILER.WITHIN.1.000.NUMBER and RETAILER.WITH.ASCHOOL.WITHIN.1.000_NUMBER are the next three most possible variables which may has missing values. For each of those variables, there are around 75 rows have missing values in them separately. 4.3 Youth smoking data set Now, we use our data as input and analyze its missing values patterns. Before plotting the missing values pattern, we first need to delete several questions from our data set. Among our data set, several questions, like what race you are, and each race represented a single question, which only allows our participants to choose one race and lead to all other questions missing values, should not be considered into our missing values pattern. Thus, we delete those questions before running the plotting function. Another thing that needs to be mentioned is that we will analyze the data set year by year since our data set is extensive. By doing this, the final result is more precise and easy to understand. Here is a reference of questions. [1] &quot;How old are you?&quot; [2] &quot;What is your sex?&quot; [3] &quot;What grade are you in?&quot; [4] &quot;Have you ever smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?&quot; [5] &quot;How old were you when you first smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?&quot; [6] &quot;About how many cigarettes have you smoked in your entire life?&quot; [7] &quot;During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?&quot; [8] &quot;When was the last time you smoked a cigeratte, even one or two puffs?

By running the function, we find the most common missing variable is Q29, which, according to the codebook, is the question During the past 30 days, what brand of cigarettes did you usually smoke. This question is almost missed in every single row. The most common missing value pattern for the 2020 data set is missing q29, q27, q30, q45,q36, q26, q23, q24, q25, which correspondingly are During the past 30 days, what brand of cigarettes did you usually smoke?, During the past 30 days, on the days you smoked, about how many cigarettes did you smoke per day? A pack usually has 20 cigarettes in it., Menthol cigarettes are cigarettes that taste like mint. During the past 30 days, were the cigarettes that you usually smoked menthol?, How old were you when you first used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip, even just a small amount?, How old were you when you first smoked a cigar, cigarillo, or little cigar, even one or two puffs?, When was the last time you smoked a cigeratte, even one or two puffs? (Please choose the first answer that fits), How old were you when you first smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?, About how many cigarettes have you smoked in your entire life?, and During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?. For the whole 2020 data set, almost 70 percent rows have missing values for those variables. Now let us look at the 2019 data set. We can find that the most common missing variable are q27, q30, q29, which are During the past 30 days, on the days you smoked, about how many cigarettes did you smoke per day? A pack usually has 20 cigarettes in it., Menthol cigarettes are cigarettes that taste like mint. During the past 30 days, were the cigarettes you usually smoked menthol?, and During the past 30 days, what brand of cigarettes did you usually smoke?. There is around 90 percent of the rows are missing those values. The most common missing value pattern is missing q27, q30, q29, q45, q36, q26, q24, q25, q23. Which are During the past 30 days, on the days you smoked, about how many cigarettes did you smoke per day? A pack usually has 20 cigarettes in it., Menthol cigarettes are cigarettes that taste like mint. During the past 30 days, were the cigarettes you usually smoked menthol?, During the past 30 days, what brand of cigarettes did you usually smoke?, How old were you when you first used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip, even just a small amount?, How old were you when you first smoked a cigar, cigarillo, or little cigar, even one or two puffs?, When was the last time you smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs? (Please choose the first answer that fits), About how many cigarettes have you smoked in your entire life?, During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?, and How old were you when you first smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?. There are around 60 percent of rows have such a missing pattern. For the 2018 data set, the missing values patterns have a huge difference with 2019 and 2020. For this year, the complete case is the most common pattern. There is around 80 percent of rows have such a pattern. This years most common missing variable is q44, which is the question Have you ever used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip, even just a small amount?. Around 420 rows in the 2018 data set have missing values on this variable. For the 2017 data set, the pattern is very similar to 2018. The complete case is the most common missing value pattern, and around 85 percent of rows have such a pattern. The most common missing variable here is also q44, which is Have you ever used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip, even just a small amount?, and there are around 300 rows have missing values on this variable. For the 2016 data set, the most common missing values pattern is still the complete case, and there is around 85 percent of rows have such a pattern. The most common missing variable here is q17, which is Have you ever been curious about using an e-cigarette?, and there are around 500 rows that have missing values on this variable. In conclusion, by observing the overall five years missing values patterns plot, we can find that participants in 2019 and 2020 do not pay enough attention to the smoking issue. For these two years, there are many questions with missing values, and the whole data set has clear missing value patterns, which can be interpreted as those participates do not take the smoking problems seriously at all, they do not remember what brand of cigarettes they are smoking, they do not remember when is the first time they smoke, they do not remember how many cigarettes they smoke in the past month All of those just showed how indifferent attitudes they have when asked about their smoking issue. Those indifferent attitudes did not even exist in 2018, 2017, and 2016, which clearly showed how the youth smoking problem became more and more serious those days. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Advertisement 5.2 Race 5.3 Smoking Habits", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Advertisement It is not surprising that tobacco advertisements appears in everyday lives. One possible reason that youth start using tobacco products are because of ads E-cigarettes are becoming popular in recent years as they have some fruity/sweet flavor comparing to traditional tobacco. We could clearly discover a trend that ads for e-cigarettes are increasing on the Internet and stores but not on TV or streaming services. The possible reason for the difference is that there are stricter control on what would be on TV than on the Internet and stores since the latter are the primary source where people gets tobacco products. Looking at the TV or streaming services plot, we can also relate the decreasing of tobacco/e-cigarettes ads to the legislation that legal age for tobacco products were raised from 18 to 21 years old in 2019. Another perspective we want to focus on is the relationship between ages, grades, and how often those youth see ads about tobacco products ads. As we all know, peoples resistance to some attractive things will also increase as people grow. Thus, if a teenager sees too much promotion about cigarettes when he was even younger, it will be no surprise that this teenager started smoking at a very young age. So, we made those plots that describe the relationship between the age or grade and how often they see promotions. The first graph here is ages vs. how often they see promotions. Let us first analyze traditional tobacco products and cigarettes, which is the upper part of this graph. Based on those graphs, we can clearly see that around 37 percent of 9 years old children always saw promotions for tobacco products through the internet. This number is terrifying because if a child has been affected by those tobacco promotions since nine years old, it will be very common for this child to become a smoking youth person. For the store, it looks like there are just constant promotions hung in those stores, and no matter who entered the store will be affected by it. This also can be shown through the plot. Based on the plot, for all ages people, around 15 to 30 percent of total popularity always saw promotions for tobacco products. Similarly, TV and streaming services here still affect the least amount of people. Those numbers are also decreasing, which can be interpreted as people who work for TV or streaming service are taking this seriously and trying to control the ads about tobacco products. Then, we switch our view to e-cigarettes, which are the lower part of the graph. Based on the graph, we can see that, no matter through which way, a large number of nine years old child always see the promotion of e-cigarettes. The promotion for e-cigarettes reached its peak in 2017 and there are around 30 to 40 percent of nine-year-old children always see those ads from both the internet, convenience stores, and TV. Although this number decreased a lot in 2020, those e-cigarettes promotions still affected a lot of young teenagers and children. Now, let us look at the relationship between grades and promotions of tobacco products. The interesting thing here is that a group of people is labeled as ungraded, and around 40 percent of people in this group always see promotions for both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. As we all know, the grade should be related to ages, which means ungraded teenagers may have dropped their school or their family can not afford the education. It is obvious that a child or teenager without enough education will always be affected by smoking ads, since they may spend too much time on the internet, TV shows instead of school. Those children and teenagers are easier to smoke when they become youth adult. 5.2 Race As we can see by the breakdown by race/ethnicity above, almost 1 in every 4 of the youth that identify as Cuban have tried smoking. The percentage of youth identifying as Cuban who have tried smoking is over twice as much as the percentage of youth who identify as Asian. The percentage of the youth who identify as Hispanic or Latino and have tried smoking is about 17%, which is greater than most other race/ethnicities other than American Indian or Alaska Native. Approxmately 1 in 5 of the youth who identity as American Indian or Alaska Native have tried smoking. 5.3 Smoking Habits "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Here is our interactive plot about how many people quit smoking by coloring different groups. You could select different group for coloring on the top left corner. You could change zoom and drag to see the color in different clusters. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion After our exploration of the CDCs National Youth Tobacco Survery (NYTS) using the past five years, we discovered interesting trends surrounding tobacco interest and usage in the youth population of America. Through this exploration, we were able to address and answer a few questions surrounding youth tobacco behavior. As we began our dive into the survey results, we were interested in how the younger population was being exposed to tobacco products. We investigated this further by looking at the questions related to advertisement placements. These questions asked the survey taker how often they saw ads on the Internet, in local stores, or on TV/streaming services. We observed that current trends show e-cigarette ads are increasing on the Internet and in stores more than they are on TV/steaming services. One reason for this may be that there are stricter rules on what is allowed to be advertised via TV/streaming that in stores and the Internet. It could also be a casualty of tobacco companies trying to advertise to adults who are in a store and could buy the products right away. A more macro influence that occurred in 2019 that couldve led to the decrease in ads seen could be the legislation that increased the legal age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21 in 2019. This wouldve prompted tobacco companies to shift their target demographic for ads to a higher age. Through our analysis, we also inspected the race and ethnicity of the youth population. Interestingly, we saw that nearly 1 in 4 of the youth that identify as Cuban and about 1 in 5 American Indian or Alaska Native youth have tried smoking before. As we looked for a reason for why this ratio may be so high, our best guess is that it may be related to cultural norms that are not present in other race and ethnicities. We were also surprised to see a range of almost a 13% difference between the lowest and highest percentage of youth who have tried smoking when broken down by race and ethnicity. This could suggest that tobacco companies may have unfair targeting strategies for youth in certain demographics more so than others. Further research behind specific tobacco companies may be needed to fully make this connection.
