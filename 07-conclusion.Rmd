# Conclusion
After our exploration of the CDC's National Youth Tobacco Survery (NYTS) using the past five years, we discovered interesting trends surrounding tobacco interest and usage in the youth population of America. Through this exploration, we were able to address and answer a few questions surrounding youth tobacco behavior.

As we began our dive into the survey results, we were interested in how the younger population was being exposed to tobacco products. We investigated this further by looking at the questions related to advertisement placements. These questions asked the survey taker how often they saw ads on the Internet, in local stores, or on TV/streaming services. We observed that current trends show e-cigarette ads are increasing on the Internet and in stores more than they are on TV/steaming services. One reason for this may be that there are stricter rules on what is allowed to be advertised via TV/streaming that in stores and the Internet. It could also be a casualty of tobacco companies trying to advertise to adults who are in a store and could buy the products right away. A more macro influence that occurred in 2019 that could've led to the decrease in ads seen could be the legislation that increased the legal age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21 in 2019. This would've prompted tobacco companies to shift their target demographic for ads to a higher age.
